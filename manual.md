Assignment 4 - Tip Calculator

To use the Tip Calculator Android app, please follow the directions below:
1. First, enter the amount of the check in the text box next to the description "Check amount:"
2. Second, enter the number of people who are splitting the bill in the text box next to the description "Party size:"
3. Warning - If the check size is below zero, a toast will alert you. If the number of people is equal to or less than zero, a toast will alert you.
4. Once you enter a valid check amount and party size, hit the "Compute Tip" button. Note - if you receive a toast saying "Incorrect Value", hitting the button will not generate any numbers. 
5. The six text boxes below the button will auto-populate with the values below:
	i. The 15% tip text box is the tip each person will owe if the party decides to tip 15%. This number represents each person's tip.
	ii. The 15% total text box is the total amount each person will owe if the party decides to tip 15%. This number represents each person's tip and share of check. 
	iii. The 20% tip text box is the tip each person will owe if the party decides to tip 20%. This number represents each person's tip.
	iv. The 20% total text box is the total amount each person will owe if the party decides to tip 20%. This number represents each person's tip and share of check. 
	v. The 25% tip text box is the tip each person will owe if the party decides to tip 25%. This number represents each person's tip.
	vi. The 25% total text box is the total amount each person will owe if the party decides to tip 25%. This number represents each person's tip and share of check. 
	
Note - the app assumes that the check will be split equally among each person in the party.
